## Project Overview

The N-Queens problem asks: place N queens on an N×N chessboard such that no two queens attack each other — no shared row, column, or diagonal.

This project extends the classical problem into a **comparative AI system** by:

- Implementing 4 solving approaches from the syllabus
- Framing the system as a **Simple Reflex Intelligent Agent**
- Modelling the problem as a **Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)**
- Comparing all solvers on time, memory, and nodes expanded
- Visualising constraint propagation, search state, and solver progress live

Test sizes: **N = 4, 6, 8, 10, 12**

## Features

Seven features, each tied to a specific syllabus term:

### 1. Constraint Visualizer
Each empty cell is coloured based on attack status:
- **Green** — no queen can attack this cell
- **Red** — one or more queens attack this cell
- **Crown (♛)** — queen placed here

After each queen placement, newly blocked cells flash to show constraint propagation live. This makes CSP visible as a process, not just a concept.

**Syllabus anchor:** CSP, constraint propagation — Unit 3

---

### 2. Solver Race Mode
All four solvers run simultaneously (via staggered polling). Each has its own progress bar and step counter updating in real time. The first solver to find a solution highlights in green.

Makes it immediately obvious why informed search outperforms uninformed search.

**Syllabus anchor:** Search algorithms comparison — Unit 2

---

### 3. PEAS Panel + Task Environment Table
Displays the full Intelligent Agent model:

**PEAS:**
| Component | Definition |
|-----------|------------|
| Performance | Solve time + nodes expanded |
| Environment | N×N chessboard |
| Actuator | Queen placement |
| Sensor | Current board state |

**Task Environment Properties:**
- Fully Observable
- Deterministic
- Static
- Discrete
- Single-Agent

**Syllabus anchor:** Intelligent Agent, Types of Agents, Task Environment — Unit 3

---

### 4. BFS Failure Message
When BFS exceeds the time limit, displays:

```
BFS halted at N=10 — exponential queue growth.
Memory exceeded practical limit.
```

Honest, minimal, directly tied to uninformed search theory.

**Syllabus anchor:** Uninformed search limits — Unit 2

---

### 5. Conflict Heatmap
Each cell's background darkness is proportional to how many queens currently attack it. Cells with more conflicts are darker. Computed as:

```python
attack_count[row][col] = number of placed queens that can reach (row, col)
```

**Syllabus anchor:** CSP constraint domain — Unit 3

---

### 6. Search Snapshot
Displays the current search state for the active solver:

```
Depth: 5   |   Exploring: row 5 → col 3
```

Variables already tracked inside each solver — surfaced directly to the UI.

**Syllabus anchor:** Problem space and search — Unit 2

---

### 7. State Representation Panel
Displays the board as a formal state array:

```
State = [0, 4, 7, 5]
```

Index = row, value = column where queen is placed. Directly shows the problem formulation abstraction from Unit 1.

**Syllabus anchor:** Problem formulation, state space — Unit 1

## Algorithm Details

### BFS — Breadth First Search
- **Data structure:** `collections.deque` (queue)
- **Strategy:** Explores all states level by level
- **Heuristic:** None (uninformed)
- **Expected behaviour:** Finds optimal solution but exhausts memory rapidly. Fails above N=8 in practice.
- **CSP note:** No constraint checking until full placement — highly inefficient
- **Hard stop — required:** BFS must never run unchecked or it will freeze the UI during a live demo.

```python
BFS_NODE_LIMIT = 100_000

if nodes_expanded > BFS_NODE_LIMIT:
    return {
        "solved": False,
        "nodes": nodes_expanded,
        "error": "BFS halted — node limit reached"
    }
```

Return `nodes_expanded` even on halt so the dashboard renders a partial bar rather than a blank.

### DFS — Depth First Search / Backtracking
- **Data structure:** Recursion stack
- **Strategy:** Place queen row by row, backtrack on conflict
- **CSP framing:**
  - Variables: one per row (which column)
  - Domain: columns 1 to N
  - Constraints: no shared column, no shared diagonal
- **Expected behaviour:** Fast for small N, deeper backtracking for larger N

### Best First Search
- **Data structure:** `heapq` (priority queue)
- **Strategy:** Always explore state with lowest heuristic value
- **Heuristic:** `h(n) = number of attacking queen pairs on board`
- **Expected behaviour:** Significantly faster than BFS, guided toward conflict-free placements

### A* Search
- **Data structure:** `heapq` (priority queue)
- **Formula:** `f(n) = g(n) + h(n)`
  - `g(n)` = number of queens placed so far (depth)
  - `h(n)` = number of attacking pairs (admissible — each requires at least one move to fix)
- **Expected behaviour:** Best balance of completeness and efficiency for medium N

---

## Intelligent Agent Design

### Agent Type
**Simple Reflex Agent** — acts on current percept (board size N) using a fixed rule set.

### Selection Rules (`agent.py`)

```python
def select_algorithm(n: int) -> str:
    if n <= 6:
        return "bfs"
    elif n <= 15:
        return "astar"
    else:
        return "best_first"
```

### Rule Display in UI
The AgentPanel shows:
```
Rule applied: N between 7 and 15 → A* selected
```

This is an honest rule-based explanation — not claimed as inference or learning.

### PEAS Model

| Component | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Performance measure | Minimise solve time and nodes expanded |
| Environment | N×N chessboard of given size |
| Actuators | Queen placement at (row, col) |
| Sensors | Current board state — queen positions |

### Task Environment Properties

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Observability | Fully observable |
| Determinism | Deterministic |
| Dynamics | Static |
| Continuity | Discrete |
| Agents | Single-agent |

---

## UI Components

### `Board.jsx`
Renders the N×N chessboard. Accepts a `queens` array (state representation) and renders crowns at placed positions.

### `ConstraintView.jsx`
Overlays each cell with a colour:
- Computes `attacked[row][col]` for every empty cell after each step
- Green = 0 attacks, gradient to red as attacks increase
- Newly blocked cells transition with a brief flash animation

### `SolverRace.jsx`
- Polls each solver's step count every 100ms
- Updates 4 progress bars independently
- Displays `Solver: Step N` below each bar
- Winner highlighted on completion

### `Dashboard.jsx`
- Reads from `runs.json` via API
- Renders Chart.js bar charts for each metric across N = 4, 6, 8, 10, 12
- BFS bars show partial/failed data where applicable

### `AgentPanel.jsx`
- Static PEAS table
- Task environment properties table
- Agent rule display (which rule fired, which algorithm selected)

### `StatePanel.jsx`
- State array: `State = [0, 4, 7, 5, ...]`
- Search snapshot: `Depth: 5 | Exploring: row 5 → col 3`
- Updates on each solver step

### `/solve` request body
```json
{
  "n": 8
}
```

### `/solve` response
```json
{
  "bfs": {
    "algorithm": "bfs", "n": 8, "solved": false,
    "nodes": 100000, "time_ms": 3200, "memory_kb": 18400, "steps": 100000,

## Performance Metrics

Collected for each solver run and stored in `runs.json`.

### Log entry schema

Each run appends exactly one object:

```json
{
  "algorithm": "astar",
  "n": 8,
  "nodes": 152,
  "time_ms": 14,
  "memory_kb": 240,
  "steps": 33,
  "solved": true,
  "timestamp": 1710412800
}
```

`timestamp` is `int(time.time())` — lets the dashboard order runs and filter by most recent session.

For a halted BFS run, `solved` is `false` and `nodes` still contains the count reached before the limit, so the dashboard can render a partial bar rather than showing nothing:

```json
{
  "algorithm": "bfs",
  "n": 10,
  "nodes": 100000,
  "time_ms": 3200,
  "memory_kb": 18400,
  "steps": 100000,
  "solved": false,
  "error": "BFS halted — node limit reached",
  "timestamp": 1710412800
}
```

### Metric collection

| Metric | How measured |
|--------|-------------|
| `nodes` | Incremented on each state visit inside solver |
| `time_ms` | `time.time()` before and after solve call, converted to ms |
| `memory_kb` | `sys.getsizeof(queue/stack)` at peak, converted to KB |
| `solved` | Boolean — did solver return a valid solution within limits |
| `steps` | Incremented on each queen placement attempt |
| `timestamp` | `int(time.time())` at solve start |
